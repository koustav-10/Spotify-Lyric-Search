# Spotify Lyric Search 

This project implements a text-identification system that predicts the **song title and artist**
given a small snippet of lyrics using **TF-IDF and cosine similarity**.

## Dataset
Spotify 50k+ Songs Dataset

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK

## Methodology
1. Text preprocessing (cleaning, stop-word removal, lemmatization)
2. TF-IDF vectorization
3. Cosine similarity for lyric matching

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python lyric_search.py
